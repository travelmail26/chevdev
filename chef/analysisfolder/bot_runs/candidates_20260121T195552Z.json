And it gets brown almost like it\u2019s frying while it\u2019s foaming but it doesn\u2019t burn and the after result is a pretty sweet very nutty butter once it\u2019s strained.

Stir every 30-45 min if possible (or shake pan).\n   - Goal: Translucent, soft, and reduced by half. Water evaporates, butter melts into onions.\n   - Your fluctuating high-200s worked well here\u2014keeps it gentle.\n\n### 3. **Browning/Caramelization (1-2 hours at 325-375\u00b0F)**\n  "

A small pinch of sugar can help browning if you like, but it\u2019s optional.\n- If the pan starts to dry out or brown too fast, splash in a little water, stock, or vinegar to deglaze and lift the fond.\n- For deeper color, keep cooking slowly for another 20\u201340 minutes, watching for the onions to turn a rich amber and feel very soft.\n\nA few quick questions to tailor the guidance:\n- How many onions are you caramelizing, and what type are they (yellow, white, red)?\n- What fat are you using, and have you added salt yet?\n- What kind of pan are you using (cast iron, stainless, nonstick) and what burner setting do you usually use?\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can pull a caramelized onion met..."

Its face was a disk of matte ceramic with two circles of soft light where eyes should be, and on the underside of its arms there were scars from a life before: serial stamps, a number that had belonged to another kind of factory. The owner, Marianne, had bought it secondhand when her wrist finally refused to flip another omelet. The invoice called it Culinary Assistance Unit P-9, but Marianne squinted at the letters and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be called Pi\u00f1a,\u201d because when the robot stirred the pineapple jam, the room smelled like a bright memory of summer.\n\nPi\u00f1a learned fast. Not like a person learns, with a life spent boiling and burning, but by tasting the air as onions met butter; by mapping the delicate collapse of a tomato from orb to sauce; by listening to the octave shift of a simmer turning into a boil, the way a violin slides into the note with a small ache.

Pots hung from a rack that swayed with the turns. The knives slept in a felt-lined drawer that clicked shut with dignity. The stove was an old six-burner whose knobs felt like the wrists of reliable friends.\n\nAt the heart of that kitchen car stood a cook who did not sweat and did not tire, who measured heat in degrees and in something else that it could not name. On its front housing somebody had painted a sprig of thyme years ago and nicked the last leaf with a screwdriver by accident, which gave the thing a look of having once been in a fight and come out wiser. On its registration plate it read: Mobile Emergency Sustenance Interface, Series E.

These can brighten the sauce and add complexity.\n\n2. **Egg Yolks and Temperature Control**:  \n   Cooking the egg yolk briefly until about 160\u00b0F is fine, but to prevent the risk of curdling and achieve a more velvety consistency, you might want to gently temper the yolk before adding it to the cream. For example:\n   - Whisk the yolk in a small bowl.\n   - Slowly add a small amount of the hot cream while whisking vigorously.\n   - Then, add this mixture back into the pan and cook gently until just thickened.\n\n3. **Roasting Tomatoes**:  \n   Your roasting method sounds spot-on. To deepen the tomato flavor, you could sprinkle a tiny bit of sea salt or a pinch of sugar before roasting. Also, a sprinkle of fresh herbs like basil or thyme aft..."

Here are some suggestions and tweaks that might enhance your dish further:\n\n1. **Balancing the Cream and Egg**:  \n   Reducing heavy cream until mostly fat is a good technique for a rich sauce, but to add more depth and a smoother texture, consider adding a splash of lemon juice or a pinch of Dijon mustard. These can brighten the sauce and add complexity.\n\n2. **Egg Yolks and Temperature Control**:  \n   Cooking the egg yolk briefly until about 160\u00b0F is fine, but to prevent the risk of curdling and achieve a more velvety consistency, you might want to gently temper the yolk before adding it to the cream. For example:\n   - Whisk the yolk in a small bowl.\n   - Slowly add a small amount of the hot cream while whisking vigorously.\n   - Then, add this mixture back into the pan and cook gently until just thickened.\n\n3. **Roasting Tomatoes**:  \n   Your roasting method sounds spot-on. To deepen the tomato flavor, you could sprinkle a tiny bit of sea salt or a pinch of sugar before roasting. Also, a sprinkle of fresh herbs like basil or thyme aft..."

The pan is swinging between around 160\u00b0F and over 200\u00b0F, and hitting exactly 180\u00b0F is proving tough.\n\nHere are practical steps to stabilize it:\n- Check thermometer accuracy: test in boiling water (should read 212\u00b0F at sea level). If it\u2019s off, note the offset or calibrate if possible.\n- Use a probe thermometer in the liquid: clip or insert into the sauce to read the actual cooking temp rather than just the surface.\n- Make small heat adjustments and wait: adjust the burner in small increments, then wait 1\u20132 minutes for the temp to settle before rechecking.\n- Consider a heat diffuser or thicker pan support: a diffuser or a cast-iron pad between burner and pan can smooth out swings.\n- Preheat and seed with stable temps: let the pan come to temp before adding ingredients, and avoid adding cold items that drop the temp.\n- Target a range, not a single number: aim for roughly 175\u2013185\u00b0F and tweak to stay there rather than chasing 180 exactly.\n\nIf you want, tell me what thermometer you\u2019re using and I can tailor the steps to your setup."

Start at a lower setting, then increase or decrease in small increments until you stabilize near 180\u00b0F, stirring to distribute heat.\n- If 2 runs hot, try a setting between low and medium (or just below 2) and give it a longer preheat while you watch the temp.\n- Diffuse the heat: use a heat diffuser or a thicker/heavier pan between the burner and the heavy bottom pan to even out temps.\n- Consider moving the pan to a different burner that runs cooler, or briefly lift off heat and let residual heat finish to maintain around 180\u00b0F."

But the next time I close the door the temperature crept up to a little over 300\u00b0 and it ended up baking it. But because when I scraped off when I took off the salmon there was a little bit of collagen and fat left on the top, when it got to about 300\u00b0 it ended up kind of frying the skin that had been somewhat dehydrated in its own fat and it was quite tasty.

I had to start it higher and then go lower to the flame was on the burner flame was almost extinguished and then it\u2019s it really slowly heated up from maybe 140\u00b0 and then it just continued climbing to some parts of the pan or 180 I think some parts of the pan are about 200 but that was one way that I tested how to keep the heat because I wanna keep the heat below like 204\u00b0and anything higher than that was too much so the slow gradient is how I tested it"
