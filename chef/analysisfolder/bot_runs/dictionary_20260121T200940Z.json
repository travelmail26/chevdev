And it gets brown almost like it\u2019s frying while it\u2019s foaming but it doesn\u2019t burn and the after result is a pretty sweet very nutty butter once it\u2019s strained. And then I did that again and it got even sweeter with the same butter but by the time all the by the time you do it more than once it reduces by like maybe 1/3 to 1/4 of what it Was"
