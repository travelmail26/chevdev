A gentle, slow caramelization will give you deeper flavor.\n\nQuick tips if you want to salvage and finish nicely:\n- Lower the heat to low or medium-low for a steady, light sizzle (around a gentle simmer). If you\u2019re at 160\u2013200\u00b0C, try closer to low heat and adjust as needed.\n- Stir every few minutes early on to prevent sticking, then gradually ease to stir every 5\u201310 minutes as moisture releases.\n- Use fat (1\u20132 tbsp oil or butter per large onion) and a pinch of salt to help draw out moisture. A small pinch of sugar can help browning if you like, but it\u2019s optional.\n- If the pan starts to dry out or brown too fast, splash in a little water, stock, or vinegar to deglaze and lift the fond.\n- For deeper color, keep cooking slowly for another 20\u201340 minutes, watching for the onions to turn a rich amber and feel very soft.\n\nA few quick questions to tailor the guidance:...",
