A small pinch of sugar can help browning if you like, but it\u2019s optional.\n- If the pan starts to dry out or brown too fast, splash in a little water, stock, or vinegar to deglaze and lift the fond.\n- For deeper color, keep cooking slowly for another 20\u201340 minutes, watching for the onions to turn a rich amber and feel very soft.\n\nA few quick questions to tailor the guidance:..."
