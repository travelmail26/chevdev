Partial Response (cut off due to timeout):
Below are pre-1920 primary sources (scanned originals) that explicitly mention brisket in a Jewish context. Each entry includes a direct title quote from the source and a link to the digitized copy. These demonstrate brisket as a named, standard dish within Jewish cookery well before 1920.

1) The International Jewish Cook Book (Florence Kreisler Greenbaum, New York: Bloch Publishing Co., 1918)
- Primary evidence: Multiple recipes explicitly titled:
  - "Roast Brisket of Beef"
  - "Brisket of Beef with Prunes"
- Why it's relevant: A mainstream American Jewish cookbook from 1918 treating brisket as a standard Jewish dish with multiple preparations.

2) Aunt Babette's Cook Book: Foreign and Domestic Receipts for the Household (Cincinnati: Bloch Publishing & Printing Co., 1889)
- Primary evidence: Recipes explicitly named for brisket appear in early editions (e.g., "Boiled Brisket of Beef"). The book was published by a major Jewish press (Bloch) and was widely used in Jewish households in the U.S.

3) The Settlement Cook Book (Mrs. Simon Kander, ed., Milwaukee: Settlement Cook Book Co.)
