Whole wheat croissants (sources 1 and 2)\n2. Different types of French flour (T45 vs T55) (source 3)\n3. General flour considerations for croissants (sources 4 and 5)\n\nLet me organize this into a comprehensive answer covering different flour types and their specific recipes/considerations.\n\nI need to remember:\n- Include direct quotes from sources with full URLs\n- Cite properly with brackets\n- Don't mention that I'm using search results\n- Format well with headers and clear structure\n- Focus on the different flour types and their specific recipes\n\nKey information:\n- Whole wheat: Need specific types (stone ground, sifted, fine milled)\n- Fresh milled flour combinations\n- European flours (T45 vs T55)\n- Protein content considerations\n- Specific recipes for different flour types\n\nI should organize this by flour type and include the specific recipes and considerations for each.\n</think>\n\nCroissants can be successfully made with various flour types, each offering unique characteristics and requiring specific techniques. Here are detailed recipes and considerations for different flour options.\n\n## Whole Wheat Croissants\n\nWhole wheat flour presents unique challenges for croissant making since it \"acts absolutely different, comparing to regular flour, it is heavier, thirstier and less stretchy\"[1](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/). However, with the right flour selection and technique, you can achieve excellent results.\n\n**Key Flour Requirements:**\nThe most important factor is using flour that is \"suitable for whole wheat croissants (stone ground, sifted and fine milled)\"[1](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/). Quality matters significantly - Janie's Mill Organic Sifted Artisan Bread Flour is specifically recommended for achieving \"very light\" croissants \"with a beautiful color and unbelievable flavor\"[1](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/).\n\n**Whole Wheat Croissant Recipe (12 croissants):**\n- 500g Janie's Mill Organic Sifted Artisan Bread Flour (100%)\n- 235g lukewarm milk (47%)\n- 85g lukewarm water (17%)\n- 55g sugar (11%)\n- 25g soft butter for the dough (5%)\n- 10g salt (2%)\n- 5g dry instant yeast (1%)\n- 300g rolling butter (60%) - European butter with 82%+ fat content[1](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/)\n\nFor enhanced flavor complexity, you can substitute 100g of the main flour with 50g Turkey Red flour and 50g Organic Black Emmer flour[1](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/).\n\n## Fresh Milled Flour Croissants\n\nFresh milled flour creates croissants that are \"tender, flaky, and oh so beautifully soft. (even without sifting the bran and germ out!)\"[2](https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/). This approach uses a combination of different wheat varieties for optimal results.\n\n**Fresh Milled Flour Combination Recipe:**\n- 2\u215b cup Fresh Milled Flour combo (250g): \"1/3 soft white 83g, 1/3 Kamut 83g, and 1/3 hard white 84g\"[2](https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/)\n- 1 tsp salt\n- \u215b cup sugar (25g)\n- 1\u00bc tsp instant yeast\n- 2 TBSP softened butter (28g)\n- \u00bc cup warm whole milk (59g)\n- \u00bd cup warm water (120g)\n- **Butter Layer:** 8 TBSP European Style Butter (113g) - frozen, then grated[2](https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/)\n\n## European Flour Types: T45 vs T55\n\nThe choice between French flour types generates considerable debate among professionals. The classification system refers to mineral content, but protein content is equally crucial.\n\n**T55 Flour Advantages:**\nT55 flour is widely recommended because \"you can get great results from a flour with 13% protein\"[3](https://www.scoolinary.com/forums/discussion/which-flour-is-better-for-croissants). Professional bakers note that \"almost all chefs suggest that T45 is good for cakes because it has low protein content and they are recommended to use T55 for croissants and baked goods\"[3](https://www.scoolinary.com/forums/discussion/which-flour-is-better-for-croissants).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\nDon't focus solely on the T-rating since it's \"just the mineral content. This Grau Rouge flour mentioned is t45 but most importantly it has around 13% protein\u2026 that's what you want!\"[3](https://www.scoolinary.com/forums/discussion/which-flour-is-better-for-croissants). The flour's origin also matters - \"as long as the flour comes from Europe/Canada it is good for croissant. As it stretches nicely. Australian/NZ flour I find isn't stretchy and a bit gummy\"[3](https://www.scoolinary.com/forums/discussion/which-flour-is-better-for-croissants).\n\n## High-Protein Flour Croissants\n\nContrary to common assumptions about needing low-protein flour, some bakers achieve excellent results with high-protein options. Professional experience shows \"some very tender and airy croissants that were made with some very high-protein flour. It entirely destroyed my preconception that a low-protein flour was one of the keys to producing good croissants\"[5](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants).\n\n**High-Protein Flour Recipe:**\n- 510g flour (high-protein)\n- 510g unsalted butter\n- 2 tsp yeast\n- 1 cup milk\n- 2 tsp salt\n- \u2153 cup sugar[5](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants)\n\n## General Flour Guidelines\n\n**All-Purpose vs. Bread Flour:** Both work effectively for croissants. \"Either one works\" for creating the desired flaky texture, though technique remains crucial[5](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants).\n\n**Key Success Factors:**\nRegardless of flour type, proper lamination is essential - aim for \"approximately 81 layers for croissant\"[5](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants). The dough should be kneaded \"until it doesn't get sticky\" for optimal flaky texture[5](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants).\n\nEach flour type offers unique advantages, from the nutty complexity of whole wheat to the traditional characteristics of European flours. Success depends on matching technique to your chosen flour's specific properties.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/\n[2] https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/\n[3] https://www.scoolinary.com/forums/discussion/which-flour-is-better-for-croissants\n[4] https://www.davidlebovitz.com/whole-wheat-croissants-croissant-recipe/\n[5] https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants\n",

The key is proper technique: \"knead dough until it doesn't get sticky; dough should be smooth\"[5](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants).\n\n## **General Tips for Success**\n\nRegardless of flour type, successful croissant making requires attention to:\n- **Protein content**: Aim for around 13% protein for optimal gluten development\n- **Lamination technique**: Proper butter incorporation and folding\n- **Temperature control**: Keep ingredients appropriately chilled during lamination\n- **Quality butter**: Use European-style butter with at least 82% fat content\n\nEach flour type brings unique characteristics to croissants, from the nutty complexity of whole wheat to the distinctive tang of rye flour, allowing bakers to create varied and flavorful versions of this classic pastry.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/\n[2] https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/\n[3] https://www.scoolinary.com/forums/discussion/which-flour-is-better-for-croissants\n[4] https://bojongourmet.com/rye-flour-pains-au-chocolat-chocolate/\n[5] https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants"

      "content": "<think>\nThe user is asking about croissant recipes with different types of flour. Looking at the search results, I have several sources that discuss different flour types for croissants:\n\n1. From source [1] - discusses whole wheat croissants using Janie's Mill flours, specifically mentions organic sifted artisan bread flour and options to substitute with Turkey Red and Black Emmer flours.\n\n2. From source [2] - discusses fresh milled flour croissants with a combination of soft white, Kamut, and hard white flours.\n\n3. From source [3] - discusses T45 vs T55 flour for croissants, with mentions of protein content.\n\n4. From source [4] - mentions whole wheat croissants.\n\n5. From source [5] - discusses all-purpose vs bread flour, mentions Manitoba flour, and talks about protein content.\n\nI need to provide comprehensive information about croissant recipes with different flour types, including the recipes and techniques mentioned. I should structure this with headers for different flour types and include the specific recipes where available.\n\nI need to remember to include direct quotes from each source I cite, include full URLs, and not mention that I'm using search results.\n</think>\n\nCroissants can be successfully made with a variety of flour types, each offering unique characteristics and flavors. The choice of flour significantly impacts the texture, flavor, and workability of the dough.\n\n## Whole Wheat Flour Croissants\n\nWhole wheat flour creates croissants with deeper flavor and nutritional benefits, though it requires careful flour selection and technique adjustments. **Stone ground, sifted and fine milled** flour works best for whole wheat croissants, as whole wheat flour \"is heavier, thirstier and less stretchy\" compared to regular flour[1](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/).\n\n**Whole Wheat Croissant Recipe (12 croissants):**\n- 500g organic sifted artisan bread flour (100%)\n- 235g lukewarm milk (47%)  \n- 85g lukewarm water (17%)\n- 55g sugar (11%)\n- 25g soft butter for dough (5%)\n- 10g salt (2%)\n- 5g dry instant yeast (1%)\n- 300g rolling butter (60%) with **82% or more fat content**[1](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/)\n\nFor enhanced flavor complexity, you can substitute 100g of the main flour with \"50g Turkey Red flour and 50g Organic Black Emmer flour\"[1](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/).\n\n## Fresh Milled Flour Combinations\n\nFresh milled flour croissants offer exceptional flavor when using flour combinations. A successful blend uses **\"1/3 soft white, 1/3 Kamut, and 1/3 hard white\"** flour for optimal results[2](https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/).\n\n**Fresh Milled Flour Recipe:**\n- 250g fresh milled flour combo (83g soft white, 83g Kamut, 84g hard white)\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 25g sugar\n- 1\u00bc tsp instant yeast\n- 28g softened butter\n- 59g warm whole milk\n- 120g warm water\n- 113g European style butter for lamination[2](https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/)\n\n## European Flour Classifications\n\nEuropean flours are classified differently, with T45 and T55 being common options. While **\"almost all chefs suggest that T45 is good for cakes because it has low protein content and they are recommended to use T55 for croissants and baked goods\"**[3](https://www.scoolinary.com/forums/discussion/which-flour-is-better-for-croissants), the protein content matters more than the classification.\n\n**T55 flour with 13% protein** provides excellent results for croissants. The key consideration is that **\"as long as the flour comes from Europe/Canada it is good for croissant. As it stretches nicely\"**[3](https://www.scoolinary.com/forums/discussion/which-flour-is-better-for-croissants).\n\n## All-Purpose vs. Bread Flour\n\nBoth all-purpose and bread flour can produce successful croissants. A basic recipe using either flour type includes:\n- 510g flour (all-purpose or bread)\n- 510g unsalted butter\n- 2 tsp yeast\n- 1 cup milk\n- 2 tsp salt\n- \u2153 cup sugar[5](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants)\n\nSurprisingly, **\"some very tender and airy croissants\"** have been successfully made **\"with some very high-protein flour\"**, challenging the assumption that low-protein flour is essential[5](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants).\n\n## Key Considerations for Flour Selection\n\n**Protein Content:** While traditional wisdom suggests lower protein flours, successful croissants can be made with various protein levels when proper lamination techniques are used.\n\n**Flour Origin:** European and Canadian flours tend to have better stretching properties compared to some other regional varieties.\n\n**Milling Quality:** For whole wheat varieties, stone-ground, sifted, and finely milled flours produce the best results.\n\nThe success of croissants depends not only on flour choice but also on proper lamination technique, achieving approximately 81 layers through careful folding and rolling processes, regardless of the flour type used.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/\n[2] https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/\n[3] https://www.scoolinary.com/forums/discussion/which-flour-is-better-for-croissants\n[4] https://www.davidlebovitz.com/whole-wheat-croissants-croissant-recipe/\n[5] https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/21473/which-flour-use-when-making-croissants\n",
