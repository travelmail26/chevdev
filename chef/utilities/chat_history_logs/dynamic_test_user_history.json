      "content": "<think>\nThe user is asking for two croissant recipes. Looking at the search results, I have several sources with detailed croissant recipes:\n\n1. La Cuisine de Geraldine - French recipe with detailed steps\n2. YouTube video with chef tips from Paris - has ingredients list\n3. Sally's Baking Addiction - complete homemade croissant recipe\n4. The Flavor Bender - French croissants with step by step\n5. Baran Bakery - Easy croissant recipe\n\nI need to pick two recipes and provide them in detail. Let me choose:\n1. Sally's Baking Addiction recipe (seems very detailed and complete)\n2. The Flavor Bender recipe (also detailed, French style)\n\nI need to remember to:\n- Include direct quotes from the sources\n- Include full URLs in citations\n- Format with headers and good structure\n- Follow the cooking recipe guidelines - provide step-by-step recipes with ingredients, amounts, and precise instructions\n- Never cite right after code blocks\n- Include direct quotes from each source I cite\n\nLet me structure this as two complete recipes with ingredients and instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere are two excellent croissant recipes from different sources, each with detailed instructions for making authentic, buttery croissants at home.\n\n## Recipe 1: Sally's Baking Addiction Homemade Croissants\n\nThis recipe creates \"buttery, flaky, and perfect homemade croissants\"[3](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-croissants/) and is ideal for home bakers.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n**For the Dough:**\n- 1/4 cup (4 Tbsp; 56g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature\n- 4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for rolling/shaping\n- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar\n- 2 teaspoons salt\n- 1 Tablespoon active dry or instant yeast\n- 1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) cold whole milk\n\n**For the Butter Layer:**\n- 1 and 1/2 cups (340g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature\n- 2 Tablespoons (16g) all-purpose flour\n\n**For the Egg Wash:**\n- 1 large egg\n- 2 Tablespoons (30ml) whole milk[3](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-croissants/)\n\n### Instructions\n\n**Day 1: Prepare the Dough**\n1. Make the base dough by combining all dough ingredients\n2. Prepare the butter block by mixing the butter layer ingredients until smooth\n3. Wrap both components separately and refrigerate overnight\n\n**Day 2: Lamination and Baking**\n1. Roll out the dough and encase the butter block\n2. Perform the lamination process with multiple folds and resting periods\n3. Shape the croissants into triangles and roll them up\n4. **Final Baking:** \"Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C)\" and \"bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes\"[3](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-croissants/)\n\n## Recipe 2: The Flavor Bender French Croissants\n\nThis recipe provides \"detailed, step by step instructions\" for making \"buttery, crisp, flaky croissants\"[4](https://www.theflavorbender.com/homemade-french-croissants-step-by-step-recipe/) using authentic French techniques.\n\n### Process Overview\n\nThe recipe follows the traditional French method with these key steps:\n\n**Dough Preparation:**\n1. **Make the d\u00e9trempe:** Create the base dough and \"shape into 7 x 10.5 inches rectangle (18 x 27 cm)\"\n2. **Prepare butter block:** \"Make the butter block / tourrage, shape into 5 x 6.5 inches (13 x 16.5 cm)\"[4](https://www.theflavorbender.com/homemade-french-croissants-step-by-step-recipe/)\n\n**Lamination Process:**\n1. **Encase the butter:** Place butter block in the center of the dough\n2. **First fold:** \"Roll out to a length of 16 inches (40 cm)\" then perform a \"double fold\"\n3. **Second fold:** \"Turn 90\u00b0 (so that the short side is closest to you)\" and \"roll out to a length of 15 inches (38 cm)\" for a \"single fold\"[4](https://www.theflavorbender.com/homemade-french-croissants-step-by-step-recipe/)\n\n**Shaping and Baking:**\n1. **Sheet the dough:** Roll to \"1 cm thick\" then further to \"5 mm in thickness\"\n2. **Cut triangles:** \"Mark 3.5 inch (9 cm) marks along one long edge\" then \"connect the marks on opposite edges to cut triangles\"\n3. **Final steps:** \"Shape croissants,\" then \"proof, apply egg wash, and bake\"[4](https://www.theflavorbender.com/homemade-french-croissants-step-by-step-recipe/)\n\n## Alternative Quick Recipe: Baran Bakery Easy Version\n\nFor a simpler approach, this recipe uses \"480g bread flour, plus extra for dusting, spooned and leveled\" with \"50g granulated sugar\" and \"7g instant yeast\"[5](https://baranbakery.com/easy-croissant-recipe/). The laminating process involves removing \"the dough from the fridge and on a lightly floured surface, roll it out to 16\u00d710\"\" then folding \"the dough into thirds again, this time like a paper going into an envelope\"[5](https://baranbakery.com/easy-croissant-recipe/).\n\nBoth recipes require patience and proper technique, but they will reward you with authentic, bakery-quality croissants at home. The key is maintaining proper butter temperature during lamination and allowing adequate resting time between folds.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://lacuisinedegeraldine.fr/en/homemade-croissants\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFBTrqea2g\n[3] https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-croissants/\n[4] https://www.theflavorbender.com/homemade-french-croissants-step-by-step-recipe/\n[5] https://baranbakery.com/easy-croissant-recipe/\n",
