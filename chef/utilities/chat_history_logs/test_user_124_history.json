From Supergolden Bakes - a quick and easy croissant recipe\n2. From a YouTube video - The Ultimate Croissant Making Tutorial \n3. From Julia Child's recipe\n4. From a Professional Baker video with Anna Olson\n5. From Scott Megee's Masterclass\n\nI need to provide two complete recipes with ingredients and instructions. I'll choose the first two that have the most complete information:\n\n1. The Supergolden Bakes recipe (simplified method)\n2. The Ultimate Croissant Making Tutorial recipe (traditional method)\n\nI need to include direct quotes from the sources and full URLs as specified in the personalization instructions.\n\nLet me structure this with clear sections for each recipe, including ingredients and instructions.\n</think>\n\nHere are two excellent croissant recipes I found, ranging from a simplified beginner-friendly version to a more traditional approach:\n\n## **Recipe 1: Quick and Easy Croissants (Simplified Method)**\n\nThis recipe from Supergolden Bakes offers a \"simplified quick-method dough\" that's \"great for beginners and well worth the effort!\"[1](https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/quick-and-easy-croissants-from-scratch/)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 250g (2 cups) strong bread flour\n- 150g (\u2154 cup) cold unsalted butter, cubed\n- 120ml (\u00bd cup) tepid milk\n- 3 tbsp sugar\n- 7g (1 sachet) dry active yeast\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n- 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tbsp milk for glazing[1](https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/quick-and-easy-croissants-from-scratch/)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**Dough Preparation:** Create the dough using the simplified folding method where you \"fold the short sides of the dough into the middle\" and \"rotate the dough by a quarter turn.\"[1](https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/quick-and-easy-croissants-from-scratch/)\n\n**Lamination Process:** The recipe instructs to \"roll it out again repeating steps 5-7 three more times. The dough will become more elastic as you are rolling and folding it.\"[1](https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/quick-and-easy-croissants-from-scratch/) After folding, wrap the dough and refrigerate for a couple of hours or overnight.\n\n**Shaping:** \"Roll the dough out to a rectangle three times as long as it is wide and at least 4mm thick\" and \"cut the dough into triangles about 30cm/12in long and 8cm/3in at the base.\"[1](https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/quick-and-easy-croissants-from-scratch/)\n\n## **Recipe 2: Ultimate Traditional Croissants (27 Layers)**\n\nThis recipe from The Ultimate Croissant Making Tutorial promises \"27 perfect layers of butter wrapped up in delicious dough\" that yields \"12 large croissants with a lot of layers!\"[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxDn4yz5F_Y)\n\n**Dough Ingredients:**\n- 500g bread flour (anything with more than 10% protein)\n- 150g water, cold\n- 150g whole milk, straight out of the fridge\n- 55g sugar\n- 25g fresh yeast\n- 9g salt[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxDn4yz5F_Y)\n\n**Butter Block:**\n- 250g unsalted butter\n- Egg white for coating[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxDn4yz5F_Y)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**Shaping Guidelines:** For proper croissants, \"the common guideline is to go for a triangle that has 10 centimetres in base and 28 centimeters in height and also the thickness of a croissant it's about 4 millimeters.\"[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxDn4yz5F_Y)\n\n**Rolling Technique:** Roll the dough to \"28 centimeters in height\" and \"hopefully you can roll it out in length to be 60 centimeters so that you get 12 croissants.\"[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxDn4yz5F_Y)\n\n**Baking:** \"Bake at 210\u00b0C (410\u00b0F) for around 6min, then lower to 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F) for another 10-12min until golden brown.\"[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxDn4yz5F_Y)\n\n## **Professional Tips**\n\nFor those seeking professional guidance, Anna Olson's method suggests rolling \"the dough to a rectangle about 16-inches by 12-inches\" and letting \"the croissants rise for 2 hours\" before baking at \"375 F (190 C)\" for \"about 15 minutes until a rich golden brown.\"[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K689erbK3XI)\n\nThe first recipe is ideal for beginners wanting to try croissant-making without the intensive lamination process, while the second provides the traditional method for achieving those classic flaky layers that make authentic French croissants so special.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/quick-and-easy-croissants-from-scratch/\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxDn4yz5F_Y\n[3] http://scrumptiouslyfitfood.blogspot.com/2011/08/julia-childs-croissant-recipe.html\n[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K689erbK3XI\n[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLJZLrEM-bk\n",

Quick summary, then one question.\n\nSubstitution rules\n- Active dry yeast \u2192 instant: use about 125% of the instant amount (i.e., 1.25x). Active dry is best rehydrated/\u201cproofed\u201d first.  \n- Fresh (cake) yeast \u2192 instant: fresh \u2248 3\u00d7 instant (so instant \u2248 fresh \u00f7 3).  \n- No yeast: you can use a sourdough starter (needs recipe adjustments) but chemical leaveners (baking powder/soda) won\u2019t produce proper laminated croissants.\n\nExamples (based on the recipes we discussed)\n- If a recipe calls for 8\u201310 g instant (traditional 500 g flour recipe): use ~10\u201312.5 g active dry, or ~25\u201330 g fresh yeast.  \n- If a recipe calls for 7 g instant (quick recipe, 250 g flour): use ~8.5\u20139 g active dry, or ~21 g fresh.\n\nHow to use active dry yeast in croissant dough\n1. Proof: dissolve the active dry yeast and a pinch of the recipe sugar in about 2\u20133 tbsp warm water or milk at ~38\u201343\u00b0C (100\u2013110\u00b0F). Wait 5\u201310 minutes until foamy.  \n2. Incorporate: add the foamy mix into your dough liquids. If the dough must be kept cold for lamination, let the proofed yeast cool slightly so you don\u2019t overheat the dough.  \n3. Fermentation: because you\u2019re using hand-mixing and likely want cooler dough, consider a slow bulk ferment in the fridge (overnight) for better flavor and easier lamination, or use a slightly longer room-temp bulk proof.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have any yeast but have a sourdough starter, I can convert the recipe \u2014 tell me starter hydration and how active it is.\n\nWhich type of yeast do you actually have right now (active dry, fresh/cake, sourdough starter, or none)? I\u2019ll convert the exact recipe amounts and give step-by-step notes.",
