Search result [3] from theflavorbender.com has a homemade French croissant recipe\n4. Search result [4] from baranbakery.com has an \"easy\" croissant recipe\n5. Search result [5] from sallysbakingaddiction.com has another homemade croissant recipe\n\nI should pick two different recipes that are distinct enough to provide variety. Let me choose:\n1. The yeast method recipe from natashasbaking.com (recipe [1])\n2. The French croissant recipe from the YouTube channel (recipe [2])\n\nAccording to the guidelines:\n- I need to provide step-by-step recipes with ingredients, amounts, and precise instructions\n- I need to cite the sources with direct quotes and full URLs\n- I must include at least one direct quote from each source I cite\n- I should format this as a cooking recipe following the cooking recipes rule\n\nLet me structure this properly with the two recipes.\n</think>\n\nHere are two excellent croissant recipes I found, each with distinct approaches and techniques:\n\n## Recipe 1: Classic Yeast Method Croissants\n\nThis recipe creates **\"so light and airy, crunchy on the outside, soft inside\"** croissants and makes 7-8 croissants[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/).\n\n### Ingredients\n**Main Dough:**\n- 350 g bread flour (protein 12-13%)\n- 108 g water\n- 109 g milk\n- 32 g sugar\n- 8 g salt\n- 3.85 g instant yeast\n- 205 g roll-in butter (pastry butter with 82% fat or more)\n\n### Instructions\n\n**Night Before:**\n1. **\"Dissolve yeast in water and milk mixture, add sugar, salt and all flour. Mix by hand, or on a slow speed of your mixing machine. No need to develop gluten. Dough can remain little lumpy. Gluten will develop by itself overnight.\"**[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/)\n2. Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate until next morning.\n\n**Next Day:**\n1. **\"Prepare butter for rolling. Butter has to be playable, not too soft, use parchment paper to roll it into a block, about 12-14 cm each side), transfer it to chill in the fridge for 15 minutes before rolling.\"**[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/)\n2. Remove dough from fridge and proceed with lamination process.\n3. Roll, fold, and chill the dough through multiple turns to create the signature flaky layers.\n4. Shape into croissants, proof until doubled, then bake.\n\n## Recipe 2: French Chef-Style Croissants\n\nThis recipe uses **\"chef secrets from Paris to help you master this iconic pastry\"** and incorporates professional techniques[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFBTrqea2g).\n\n### Ingredients\n**Croissant Dough:**\n- 510 g (just over 4 cups) all-purpose flour\n- 65 g (1/4 cup + 1 Tbsp) granulated sugar\n- 12 g (2 1/2 tsp) fine sea salt\n- 10 g (1 Tbsp + 1/2 tsp) instant yeast\n- 144 g (1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp) cold water\n- 144 g (1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp) cold whole milk\n- 43 g (3 Tbsp) unsalted butter, softened\n\n**Butter Layer:**\n- 283 g (1 1/4 cups) cold, unsalted butter (preferably European butter like Kerrygold)\n\n**Egg Wash:**\n- 1 large egg\n- 1 egg yolk\n- Pinch of salt\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. **Mix the dough:** Combine all dough ingredients and mix until just combined. The dough should not be overworked at this stage.\n2. **Chill:** Wrap and refrigerate the dough overnight to develop flavor and make handling easier.\n3. **Prepare butter block:** **\"Use European Butter such as Kerrygold\"** and pound it into a flat rectangle, keeping it pliable but cold[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFBTrqea2g).\n4. **Laminate:** Encase the butter in the dough and perform a series of folds, chilling between each fold.\n5. **Shape:** Roll out the final dough and cut into triangles, then roll into the classic croissant shape.\n6. **Proof and bake:** Allow shaped croissants to proof until doubled, brush with egg wash, and bake until golden brown.\n\nBoth recipes emphasize the importance of **proper temperature control** and **patience** throughout the multi-day process. The first recipe focuses on simplicity with overnight fermentation, while the second incorporates traditional French pastry techniques with specific butter recommendations for optimal results.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFBTrqea2g\n[3] https://www.theflavorbender.com/homemade-french-croissants-step-by-step-recipe/\n[4] https://baranbakery.com/easy-croissant-recipe/\n[5] https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-croissants/\n",

gluten will develop gradually in the fridge and during lamination.\n  - Lamination is still essential to create the flaky layers, using a pliable butter block that stays cold.\n- Steps overview (high level)\n  - Mix dough with dry and wet ingredients; keep dough relatively underdeveloped.\n  - Chill/dormant stage overnight to develop flavor and structure.\n  - Prepare a cold butter block suitable for rolling and folding.\n  - Roll out dough, encase the butter, and perform a series of folds and turns with resting periods to build layers.\n  - Shape croissants, proof until puffed, brush with egg wash, and bake until golden.\n- Timeline (typical two-day rhythm)\n  - Day 1: mix dough; refrigerate overnight.\n  - Day 2: roll and laminate; shape; proof; bake.\n- Equipment considerations\n  - Mixing setup (stand mixer or by hand), rolling surface, dough roller/rolling pin, plastic wrap, sharp knife or pizza wheel for cutting, parchment, baking sheets, a comfortable fridge for chilling, and a timer.\n- Common pitfalls\n  - Butter getting too warm or too hard during lamination, causing breakage or leakage.\n  - Dough over- or under-handled during folds, leading to uneven layers.\n  - Inadequate chilling between turns, reducing flakiness.\n  - Over-proofing or under-proofing during the final rise, affecting rise and texture.\n- What to expect in the finish\n  - Croissants with a crisp exterior and soft, layered interior; flavor develops with overnight chilling; texture hinges on butter integrity and lamination precision.\n\n2) Method B \u2014 Laminated (French-style) croissants\n- Core idea\n  - Traditional lamination with a careful, multi-turn folding process, using a separate butter block for the lamination; emphasis on precise butter handling and temperature control.\n- Dough components (categories)\n  - Dough base: high-protein flour, sugar, salt, yeast, cold water, cold milk\n  - Butter for lamination: a large cold block of European-style butter (for a distinct, pliable laminated sheet)\n  - Egg wash: eggs or egg yolk with salt for a glossy finish\n- Key technique concepts\n  - The dough is mixed just enough to come together, then rested in cold conditions to relax and develop flavor.\n  - A separate butter block is prepared and placed within the dough to create alternating dough\u2013butter layers through multiple folds.\n  - Lamination involves a sequence of folds (turns), with chilling between each turn to keep butter cold and pliable.\n- Steps overview (high level)\n  - Mix dough until just combined; chill overnight to enhance handling and flavor.\n  - Prepare a large, pliable butter block for lamination.\n  - Encase the butter in the dough and perform a series of folds (turns), chilling between each one.\n  - Roll out the final sheet, cut into triangles, and roll into croissant shapes.\n  - Proof until doubled, brush with egg wash, and bake to a golden color.\n- Timeline (typical two-day rhythm)\n  - Day 1: mix dough; refrigerate overnight.\n  - Day 2: prepare butter block; laminate (folds); shape; proof; bake.\n- Equipment considerations\n  - Similar to the yeast method, but with a premium emphasis on maintaining a very cold work environment, possibly using a dough blender or appropriate rolling tools to manage the butter layer.\n- Common pitfalls\n  - Butter block leaking or melting into dough during folds, ruining layers.\n  - Butter not evenly distributed or too cold to fold, causing cracks or tears.\n  - Overworking the dough or insufficient chilling between folds, leading to under-laminated texture.\n  - Temperature drift in the oven or kitchen causing uneven rise.\n- What to expect in the finish\n  - Classic laminated croissants with well-defined, crisp outer layers and a tender, flaky inside; sharper lamination results in more pronounced layers and a more delicate texture.\n\n3) Key differences at a glance\n- Fermentation approach:\n  - Yeast-method relies on overnight dough fermentation before lamination; flavor and gluten structure develop within the dough itself.\n  - Laminated method emphasizes precise lamination with a separate butter layer and tends to rely on multiple folds for structure, with flavor building through the butter layers and chilling.\n- Butter handling:\n  - Yeast-method uses a roll-in butter block but may have more flexibility around dough handling since the dough is designed to stay less gluten-bound overnight.\n  - Laminated method requires strict control of butter temperature and a well-defined butter block to avoid leakage and ensure clean, even layers.\n- Timeline and workflow:\n  - Both require overnight chilling, but the laminated method follows a more regimented folding schedule with multiple turns and careful temperature control.\n- Resulting texture:\n  - Yeast-method croissants can be very light and airy with strong but softer lamination due to the dough\u2019s fermentation profile.\n  - Laminated croissants typically have more pronounced laminated layers and a crisper exterior due to the clean separation of dough and butter sheets.\n\n4) Running both recipes in parallel (shared timeline and workflow)\n- Shared equipment and prep\n  - Use two clean workstations and clearly label which dough is for which method.\n  - Both require cold storage (refrigerator or dedicated proofing area) to maintain butter integrity and prevent over-warm dough.\n- Overlapping steps (two-day plan)\n  - Day 1 evening:\n    - Start both doughs: one for yeast-method, one for laminated method. Allow both to rest in the fridge as needed.\n  - Day 2 morning:\n    - For yeast-method: remove dough, chill butter if needed, begin lamination and folds, then shape.\n    - For laminated method: remove dough, prepare the butter block, encase butter in dough, start the fold sequence with chilling between turns.\n  - Day 2 mid-day:\n    - Shape all croissants from both methods, giving each batch its appropriate proof time.\n  - Day 2 late afternoon/evening:\n    - Preheat oven and bake the croissants in small batches as oven space allows; finish with egg wash and cooling.\n- Batch planning for a single bake session\n  - If oven space is limited, stagger baking so that both types finish in the same overall window.\n  - Use separate sheets and racks to avoid cross-contamination of flavors or butter leakage.\n  - Maintain consistent oven temperature (start around typical croissant temps, adjusting as needed for each batch).\n- Substitutions and flex options\n  - If you\u2019re short on European-style butter, use a high-fat, cold butter substitute and adjust cold-keeping steps to avoid leakage.\n  - If you don\u2019t have a dough scraper, rely on bench tools and parchment methods to move and handle dough without tearing layers (as you\u2019ve already managed).\n  - If you lack a proofer, use a warm, draft-free area or the oven\u2019s light-warmth setting with careful monitoring to avoid overheating.\n- Practical tips for success\n  - Keep everything cold during lamination to preserve butter integrity.\n  - Handle dough and butter gently to avoid tearing or breaking the layers.\n  - Use a sharp knife or scissors to trim edges cleanly for uniform shapes.\n  - Ensure even cutting and shaping to promote uniform proofing and baking.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can format this into a concrete, step-by-step two-day schedule with time blocks, plus a combined shopping list tailored to a chosen batch size (e.g., 8\u201312 croissants per method) and a plan for baking both in one session."

Looking at the search results, I can see specific measurements from the first source:\n\nFrom [1] - https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/:\n- 350 g bread flour (protein 12-13%) (100%)\n- 108 g water (31%)\n- 109 g milk (31%)\n- 32 g sugar (9 %)\n- 8 g salt (2.3 %)\n- 3.85 g instant yeast (1.1%)\n- 205 g roll-in butter (pastry butter with 82% fat or more) (58.5%)\n\nThis makes 7-8 croissants according to the source.\n\nI need to include direct quotes from the sources I cite and provide the full URL as requested in the personalization instructions. I should focus specifically on the yeast method ingredients since that's what the user is asking about.\n\nLet me also check if there are other variations in the search results that might be relevant.\n\nFrom [2] - this is a whole wheat version with different quantities:\n- 500g Janie's Mill Organic Sifted Artisan Bread Flour\n- 235g lukewarm milk (47%)\n- 85g lukewarm water (17%)\n- 55g sugar (11%)\n- 25g soft butter for the dough (5%)\n- 10g salt (2%)\n- 5g dry instant yeast (1%)\n- 300g rolling butter (60%) for lamination\n\nFrom [3] - this appears to be a different method (NatashasKitchen.com, not Natasha's Baking):\n- 18 oz all-purpose flour, or just over 4 cups\n- \u00bc cup + 1 Tbsp granulated sugar\n- 2\u00bd tsp fine sea salt or table salt\n\n\n- 1 Tbsp + 1/2 tsp instant yeast\n- \u00bd cup + 2 Tbsp cold water\n- \u00bd cup + 2 Tbsp cold whole milk\n- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened\n- 1\u00bc cups cold, unsalted butter for butter layer\n\nI'll focus on the original Natasha's Baking recipe, which provides precise metric measurements for a classic croissant yeast method. The ingredients are carefully balanced to create the perfect laminated dough, with specific percentages for each component.\n</think>\n\nBased on Natasha's Baking croissant yeast method, here are the exact ingredient quantities you'll need:\n\n## Main Dough Ingredients (Makes 7-8 croissants)\n\n**Dry Ingredients:**\n- **350g bread flour** (with 12-13% protein content) - this serves as the base structure[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/)\n- **32g sugar** (about 2 tablespoons)[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/)\n- **8g salt** (about 1\u00bd teaspoons)[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/)\n- **3.85g instant yeast** (about 1\u00bc teaspoons)[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/)\n\n**Liquid Ingredients:**\n- **108g water** (about \u00bd cup)[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/)\n- **109g milk** (about \u00bd cup)[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/)\n\n**For Lamination:**\n- **205g roll-in butter** - specifically \"pastry butter with 82% fat or more\"[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/)\n\n## Preparation Notes\n\nThe recipe emphasizes that you should \"dissolve yeast in water and milk mixture, add sugar, salt and all flour\" and mix by hand or on slow speed[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/). The author notes that \"no need to develop gluten\" as the \"gluten will develop by itself overnight\"[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/).\n\nFor the butter preparation, it needs to be \"playable, not too soft\" and should be rolled \"into a block, about 12-14 cm each side\" before being chilled for 15 minutes[1](https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/).\n\nThe recipe follows a two-day process where you prepare the dough the night before and complete the lamination and baking the next day.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://natashasbaking.com/croissant-yeast-method/\n[2] https://www.janiesmill.com/blogs/recipes/whole-wheat-croissants-natalya-syanova-natashas-baking\n[3] https://natashaskitchen.com/croissant-recipe/\n[4] https://natashasbaking.com/easy-same-day-croissant/\n[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFBTrqea2g\n",
