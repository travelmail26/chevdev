Ensure the yeast activates properly if using fresh yeast.\n   \n2. **Knead and Chill:**\n   - Knead both doughs until smooth, about 5-7 minutes. Form into balls and place them in greased bowls. Cover and let rise for about an hour or until doubled in size.\n   - After rising, refrigerate both doughs for at least 30 minutes to firm up.\n\n3. **Prepare Butter Layers:**\n   - While the dough chills, prepare the butter layer. Take the European butter, freeze it, then grate it for easier incorporation later.\n\n4. **Laminate Doughs:**\n   - Roll out each chilled dough separately into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.\n   - Spread the grated butter evenly over the surface of each rectangle.\n   - Fold each rectangle into thirds (like a letter) and roll out again. Repeat this process two more times for each dough to create layers.\n\n5. **Shape Croissants:**\n   - Cut each dough into triangles, about 4 inches at the base.\n   - Roll each triangle from the base to the tip to form a croissant shape.\n\n6. **Final Rise:**\n   - Place the croissants on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Cover and let them rise for about another hour until puffy.\n\n7. **Prepare Egg Wash:**\n   - Beat the egg with water and brush it over the croissants just before baking.\n\n8. **Bake:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Bake the croissants for about 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.\n\n9. **Cool and Enjoy:**\n   - Remove from the oven and allow cooling slightly before enjoying your delicious homemade croissants!\n\n### Timing:\nGiven your experience level and the time you have, this plan should fit within approximately four hours, including preparation, rising times, and baking.\n\nEnjoy your baking adventure!",

Looking at the search results, I can see several recipes that use different flour combinations:\n\n1. From source [1]: Fresh milled flour croissants using a combo of 1/3 soft white, 1/3 Kamut, and 1/3 hard white flour\n2. From source [2]: Whole wheat croissants using regular flour plus whole wheat flour\n3. From source [3]: Whole wheat croissants using white flour + whole wheat flour\n4. From sources [4] and [5]: Standard croissant recipes with bread flour\n\nI should focus on the recipes that specifically use two different types of flour. Sources [2] and [3] both have whole wheat + white flour combinations, and source [1] has a fresh milled flour combo. Let me structure this as two different recipes with their ingredients and equipment.\n\nI need to include direct quotes from the sources as per the personalization instructions, and include full URLs. I also need to avoid starting with a header and provide comprehensive detail.\n\nLet me organize this into two main recipes:\n1. Whole Wheat + White Flour Croissants\n2. Fresh Milled Flour Combination Croissants\n\nI should include equipment mentions where available in the search results.\n</think>\n\nCroissant recipes using two different types of flour offer exciting flavor variations and textures compared to traditional single-flour approaches. Here are two distinctive recipes that combine different flour types, each with their specific ingredients and equipment requirements.\n\n## Whole Wheat and White Flour Croissants\n\nThis combination creates croissants with enhanced flavor depth while maintaining excellent texture. According to Natasha's Baking, \"Croissants came out very light, with a beautiful color and unbelievable flavor\"[2](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/) when using this flour combination approach.\n\n**Ingredients for Dough (12 croissants):**\n- 500g Janie's Mill Organic Sifted Artisan Bread Flour (or similar high-quality bread flour)\n- 235g lukewarm milk \n- 85g lukewarm water\n- 55g sugar\n- 25g soft butter for the dough\n- 10g salt\n- 5g dry instant yeast\n- 300g rolling butter (European butter with 82% fat content or higher)\n\nFor enhanced flavor variation, David Lebovitz suggests using \"1 1/4 cups (175g) white flour, bread flour (preferably) or all-purpose flour\" combined with \"3/4 cup (105g) whole wheat flour\"[3](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/whole-wheat-croissants-croissant-recipe/) for a different ratio approach.\n\n**Equipment Needed:**\n- Digital scale (highly recommended for accurate measurements)\n- Large mixing bowl\n- Rolling pin\n- Bench scraper\n- Clean kitchen towels\n- Refrigerator space for chilling\n- Baking sheets\n- Parchment paper\n\n**Key Flour Considerations:**\nThe flour selection is critical for success. As noted, \"To achieve results you want, you have to use flour, that is suitable for whole wheat croissants (stone ground, sifted and fine milled)\"[2](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/) and whole wheat flour \"acts absolutely different, comparing to regular flour, it is heavier, thirstier and less stretchy\"[2](https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/).\n\n## Fresh Milled Flour Combination Croissants\n\nThis innovative approach uses three different fresh milled flours for complex flavor development. The recipe creator notes these are \"light, and flaky, oh what a special treat these are!\"[1](https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/)\n\n**Croissant Dough Ingredients:**\n- 2\u215b cups Fresh Milled Flour combo (250g total): \u2153 soft white (83g), \u2153 Kamut (83g), and \u2153 hard white (84g)\n- 1 tsp salt\n- \u215b cup sugar (25g)\n- 1\u00bc tsp instant yeast\n- 2 TBSP softened butter (28g)\n- \u00bc cup warm whole milk (59g)\n- \u00bd cup warm water (120g)\n\n**Butter Layer:**\n- 8 TBSP European Style Butter (113g), frozen then grated\n\n**Egg Wash:**\n- 1 egg\n- 2 tsp water\n\n**Equipment Needed:**\n- Digital scale\n- Grain mill (for fresh flour milling)\n- Grater (for frozen butter)\n- Mixing bowls\n- Rolling pin\n- Bench scraper\n- Pastry brush (for egg wash)\n- Baking sheets\n- Parchment paper\n\n**Important Timing Considerations:**\nBoth recipes require significant time investment. The fresh milled flour recipe has a \"Total Time 2 days 4 hours 17 minutes\"[1](https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/) and is described as \"a recipe that shouldn't be rushed, it is a labor of love to get them just right\"[1](https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/).\n\n## Essential Equipment Notes\n\nRegardless of which flour combination you choose, certain equipment is critical for success. A digital scale is particularly important because, as noted, \"I recommend weighing your ingredients with a digital scale, especially flour\"[4](https://baranbakery.com/easy-croissant-recipe/). For butter quality, \"Definitely take the time to source a good quality bread flour and high fat, unsalted butter (82% minimum)\"[5](https://devilsfoodkitchen.com/recipe/croissants/) for optimal results.\n\nBoth recipes emphasize patience and proper technique, with multiple chilling periods required for successful lamination and final texture development.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://grainsinsmallplaces.net/croissants-with-fresh-milled-flour/\n[2] https://natashasbaking.com/whole-wheat-croissants/\n[3] https://www.davidlebovitz.com/whole-wheat-croissants-croissant-recipe/\n[4] https://baranbakery.com/easy-croissant-recipe/\n[5] https://devilsfoodkitchen.com/recipe/croissants/\n",

Ensure the yeast activates properly if using fresh yeast.\n   \n2. **Knead and Chill:**\n   - Knead both doughs until smooth, about 5-7 minutes. Form into balls and place them in greased bowls. Cover and let rise for about an hour or until doubled in size.\n   - After rising, refrigerate both doughs for at least 30 minutes to firm up.\n\n3. **Prepare Butter Layers:**\n   - While the dough chills, prepare the butter layer. Take the European butter, freeze it, then grate it for easier incorporation later.\n\n4. **Laminate Doughs:**\n   - Roll out each chilled dough separately into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.\n   - Spread the grated butter evenly over the surface of each rectangle.\n   - Fold each rectangle into thirds (like a letter) and roll out again. Repeat this process two more times for each dough to create layers.\n\n5. **Shape Croissants:**\n   - Cut each dough into triangles, about 4 inches at the base.\n   - Roll each triangle from the base to the tip to form a croissant shape.\n\n6. **Final Rise:**\n   - Place the croissants on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Cover and let them rise for about another hour until puffy.\n\n7. **Prepare Egg Wash:**\n   - Beat the egg with water and brush it over the croissants just before baking.\n\n8. **Bake:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Bake the croissants for about 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.\n\n9. **Cool and Enjoy:**\n   - Remove from the oven and allow cooling slightly before enjoying your delicious homemade croissants!\n\n### Timing:\nGiven your experience level and the time you have, this plan should fit within approximately four hours, including preparation, rising times, and baking.\n\nEnjoy your baking adventure!"
