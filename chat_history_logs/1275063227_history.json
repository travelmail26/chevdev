Looking at the search results, I have several sources with different tomato recipes. The user specifically asked for \"two\" recipes.\n\nLet me identify some good recipe options from the search results:\n\n1. From source [1] - Ollie Dabbous tomato recipe with stuffed tomato and tomato essence\n2. From source [2] - Marcella Hazan's Tomato Sauce with Onion & Butler\n3. From source [3] - Tomato Bacon Jam\n4. From source [4] - Lentils and roasted curry tomatoes\n5. From source [5] - Caprese Salad\n\nI should pick two good recipes that are different from each other and provide details. I need to include direct quotes and full URLs as per the personalization instructions.\n\nLet me choose:\n1. Marcella Hazan's Tomato Sauce (simple but popular)\n2. Tomato Bacon Jam (more unique and interesting)\n\nI need to format this as a cooking recipe response with clear ingredients and instructions, and make sure to cite with direct quotes and full URLs.\n</think>\n\nHere are two excellent tomato recipes for you:\n\n## **Marcella Hazan's Tomato Sauce With Onion & Butler**\n\nThis is \"one of our most popular recipes, ever\" and proves that \"you're always three ingredients away from a perfect, buttery pasta sauce.\"[2](https://food52.com/story/27572-best-tomato-recipes) This classic Italian sauce is incredibly simple yet delivers exceptional flavor.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- Fresh tomatoes (or canned whole tomatoes)\n- 1 onion, halved\n- Butter\n- Salt to taste\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Combine tomatoes, onion halves, and butter in a saucepan\n2. Simmer gently for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally\n3. Remove onion halves and discard\n4. Season with salt\n5. Serve over pasta\n\n## **Tomato Bacon Jam**\n\nThis recipe is \"a good way to use up any of maybe your overripe tomatoes\" since \"it doesn't really matter what they look like cuz they're going to get cooked down.\"[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ43YhRuXUM&vl=en) The jam cooks down for about an hour, creating a perfect sweet and savory condiment.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- Overripe tomatoes, chopped\n- 1/2 pound bacon, chopped\n- Sweet onion, diced\n- 1 cup sugar\n- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Hot sauce\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Cook bacon in one skillet until crispy\n2. In another skillet, cook tomatoes and sweet onion\n3. Add sugar for sweetness, apple cider vinegar for tang\n4. Season with \"little salt, a little pepper\" and hot sauce \"to finish out the balance\"[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ43YhRuXUM&vl=en)\n5. Simmer for about 1 hour until jam-like consistency\n6. Combine with cooked bacon\n\nBoth recipes offer different ways to showcase tomatoes - the sauce highlights their pure flavor while the jam transforms them into a versatile condiment perfect for burgers, cheese boards, or toast.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/features/best-creative-tomato-recipes-chef\n[2] https://food52.com/story/27572-best-tomato-recipes\n[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ43YhRuXUM&vl=en\n[4] https://health.clevelandclinic.org/tomato-recipes\n[5] https://www.feastingathome.com/best-tomato-recipes/\n",
